## Ising Model
This code numerically estimates the temperature of the phase transition of the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice with nearest neighbor interactions.

This code is a modified version of the code for a rectangular lattice provided by Dr. Michael Rozman for Physics 2200 course at the University of Connecticut. I mainly needed to adjust the code from scanning 4 neighbors to 6. I also changed the possible energy states from 16 to 24. 

I had the code output a .png file of temperature which is the figure below. It demonstrates that the critical temperature for phase transitions of a two-dimenstional Ising model on a triangular lattice is about 3.6 (dimenstionless).
